A Windows terminal written in Zig, powered by [libghostty-vt](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) for terminal emulation.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a fork of [arya-s/phantty](https://github.com/arya-s/phantty),
> with additional features layered on top: an embedded WebView2 browser panel,
> a file explorer with Markdown/text preview, AI Agent sessions,
> an opt-in remote-access client,
> Kitty Graphics image protocol support, and a configurable background image.

## Features

- **Ghostty's terminal emulation** — uses libghostty-vt for VT parsing and terminal state
- **DirectWrite font discovery** — find system fonts by name, with per-glyph fallback for missing characters
- **FreeType rendering** — high-quality glyph rasterization with Ghostty-style font metrics
- **Sprite rendering** — box drawing, block elements, braille patterns, powerline symbols
- **Theme support** — Ghostty-compatible theme files, 450+ themes built in (default: Poimandres)
- **Background image** — render a wallpaper behind the terminal with per-cell opacity blending and four scaling modes (`fill` / `fit` / `center` / `tile`)
- **Splits and tabs** — vertical/horizontal splits, tab strip, focus-follows-mouse, equalize sizes
- **File Explorer and previews** — browse local, WSL, and SSH files; preview Markdown/text without leaving the terminal
- **Embedded browser panel** — open `http://` / `https://` URLs in a side WebView2 panel; SSH sessions tunnel loopback URLs automatically
- **AI Agent sessions** — launch the default OpenAI-compatible Agent tab directly; configure the profile in Settings
- **Kitty Graphics protocol** — display inline images and PDFs from remote shells via `imgcat.py` / `pdfcat.py`
- **Custom post-processing shaders** — Ghostty-compatible GLSL post-processing (CRT, glitch, etc.); the wallpaper is rendered inside the same FBO so effects apply uniformly
- **Opt-in remote access** — share a session key over a Cloudflare-hosted relay (disabled by default)

> [!NOTE]
> Phantty is **Windows-only**. On macOS and Linux, use [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) instead.

## Why The UI Is Custom Drawn

Phantty's main terminal UI is intentionally custom drawn instead of composed from raw Win32 controls. The terminal surface, tabs, splits, overlays, background image, shader effects, and theme colors all share one OpenGL rendering pipeline, so they can stay visually consistent and behave like one terminal canvas.

Classic Win32 controls such as `SCROLLBAR` provide native behavior, but they do not blend well with Phantty's dark theme, transparency, background images, and terminal overlays. They also make layout, DPI, and focus behavior harder to keep consistent with split panes and custom panels. For the primary terminal experience, Phantty prefers platform-aware custom controls over embedding mismatched native widgets directly.

## Building

```powershell
zig build                         # Debug build for development
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast  # ReleaseFast build for distribution
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\zig-out, .\.zig-cache -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The `Makefile` may still exist as a convenience wrapper, but normal Windows
development should use PowerShell and direct `zig` commands.

## Packaging

Phantty supports two portable Windows packages plus the local installer build:

- `portable` — lightweight portable build, run directly without installation
- `portable-webview2` — portable build with `WebView2Loader.dll` for the embedded browser
- `phantty-setup.exe` — installer build, installs to the current user's profile and creates a Start menu shortcut

Build the artifacts with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\packaging\windows\package.ps1
```

This produces:

```text
zig-out\dist\portable\phantty.exe
zig-out\dist\portable-webview2\phantty.exe
zig-out\dist\portable-webview2\WebView2Loader.dll
zig-out\dist\installer\phantty-setup.exe
```

The installer does not require administrator rights. It installs Phantty to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Phantty`, adds a Start menu entry, and registers an
uninstall entry for the current user.

## GitHub Releases

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/windows-release.yml`
publishes Windows release assets whenever a tag matching `vX.Y.Z` is pushed.

Each tagged release uploads:

- `phantty-windows-portable-vX.Y.Z.zip`
- `phantty-windows-portable-webview2-vX.Y.Z.zip`

The unsigned IExpress installer is not published for now because Windows
Defender can quarantine it as a false positive. Use the portable zip release
asset, or the `portable-webview2` zip when using the embedded browser panel.

Release notes are checked in under `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` when a release
needs curated notes. If a matching file is present, the workflow prepends it to
the GitHub release body; otherwise GitHub generated notes are used with the
asset summary.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Default chords are implemented in `[src/input.zig](src/input.zig)`. Some keys are handled first when a modal overlay is open (command center, session launcher, settings, and similar).

To confirm the running desktop version, open the command center with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `version`, and press Enter.

## File Explorer and Markdown Preview

Press `Ctrl+Shift+E` to open the left-side File Explorer. It follows the
active environment:

- Windows shells browse local Windows paths.
- WSL sessions browse the default WSL distro through `wsl.exe`.
- Phantty SSH profile sessions browse the remote host through OpenSSH helpers.

Hold `Ctrl` and click a `.md` or `.txt` file in terminal output, or double-click
a supported text file in the File Explorer, to open the right-side preview panel.
Markdown previews render
headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, inline code, links, and horizontal
rules. Text files are shown as plain text.

Open the command center with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run `Toggle Browser` to open
the embedded WebView2 browser panel. `Ctrl`-clicking an `http://` or `https://`
URL in terminal output opens it in the same right-side WebView2 panel. In SSH
profile sessions, loopback URLs such as `http://127.0.0.1:4232` and
`http://localhost:43455` are opened through an automatic local SSH tunnel;
the tunnel prefers the same local port and only increments when that port is
already occupied.
non-loopback URLs such as `https://10.10.x.x` or public websites open directly.
Click the browser panel's URL bar to type a new address; press `Enter` to
navigate. Drag the browser panel's left edge to resize it.

The preview panel can be resized by dragging its left edge and scrolled with the
mouse wheel. `Ctrl+Shift+W` closes the preview panel before closing a split.

SSH previews require Phantty's SSH profile metadata, so sessions launched from
the built-in SSH launcher are supported. Manually typing `ssh user@host` inside
a local shell is still treated as that local shell and cannot use remote file
preview yet.

For old bastions or servers that still require disabled OpenSSH algorithms, set
`ssh-legacy-algorithms = true`. This appends compatibility options for
`ssh-rsa`, `ssh-dss`, older Diffie-Hellman KEX, and CBC ciphers to Phantty's SSH
profile launches and helper `ssh.exe` / `scp.exe` commands.

## AI Chat Sessions

Open the session launcher with `Ctrl+Shift+T` and choose `AI Agent`. Phantty
opens the default AI profile directly in Agent mode. If no AI profile exists
yet, it opens the AI settings form first so you can configure the provider,
model, API key, and agent mode before the first launch.

Manage the default AI profile from Settings. Profile data is stored under
`%APPDATA%\phantty\ai_profiles`, with fields hex encoded on disk.

The first AI Chat implementation targets OpenAI-compatible chat completions.
The built-in defaults are:

- Base URL: `https://api.deepseek.com`
- Model: `deepseek-v4-pro`
- System prompt: `You are a helpful assistant.`
- Request mode: DeepSeek thinking enabled, `reasoning_effort = high`, non-streaming

If an AI profile does not include an API key and its base URL points at
DeepSeek, Phantty also checks `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the process environment.
Responses with `reasoning_content` are shown as a muted reasoning block above
the assistant reply. This follows DeepSeek's
[thinking mode guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/guides/thinking_mode).
Completed requests show elapsed time in the AI Chat status area, and token usage
when the provider returns OpenAI-compatible `usage` fields.

Agent tool commands run as hidden background child processes where possible, so
local PowerShell/cmd tool calls do not flash a separate console window.

### Agent skills

Agent chats can load local skills from `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` under
`%APPDATA%\phantty`, the current working directory, or the directory containing
`phantty.exe`.
Use `$skill-name your request` to explicitly load a skill for the next request.
The loaded skill is stored as a replayable tool result in the chat history, so
existing conversations stay reproducible even if the skill file changes later.

Local slash commands:

- `/skills` lists discovered local skills without calling the model.
- `/commands` lists local AI chat commands without calling the model.
- `/reload-skills` confirms that future skill calls will read from disk again.

For Xshell-like terminal clipboard behavior, use:

```text
copy-on-select = true
right-click-action = paste
```

`right-click-action = copy-or-paste` copies when a terminal selection is active
and pastes when there is no selection.

## Background Image

Set `background-image` in the config (or pass `--background-image`) to render a
wallpaper behind the terminal. PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, and TGA are supported.

`background-opacity` controls how strongly the theme background tints the
wallpaper:


| Value           | Effect                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1.0` (default) | Theme background is fully opaque — image is hidden, terminal looks the same as without one |
| `0.85`          | Faint watermark (image shows through ~15%)                                                 |
| `0.5`           | Equal blend                                                                                |
| `0.15`          | Image dominates with a light theme tint                                                    |
| `0.0`           | Theme tint is skipped — image at full strength                                             |


The opacity also applies to per-cell backgrounds (selections, ANSI-colored
backgrounds), so the wallpaper shows through them at the same ratio.

`background-image-mode` selects how the image is sized to the window:


| Mode             | Behavior                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fill` (default) | Cover the window, cropping the longer axis                  |
| `fit`            | Letterbox so the whole image is visible (edges may stretch) |
| `center`         | 1:1 pixel scale, centered                                   |
| `tile`           | Repeat at native size with `GL_REPEAT`                      |


The wallpaper is drawn inside the post-process framebuffer, so a custom shader
set with `--custom-shader` distorts it together with the terminal content.

```text
background-image = C:\Users\me\Pictures\wallpaper.png
background-opacity = 0.85
background-image-mode = fill
```

Save the config (or hot-reload via `Ctrl+,`) to apply changes without
restarting. Clearing the value removes the wallpaper.

## Remote Image Viewing

Phantty now accepts Kitty Graphics protocol image output, so remote shells can
display inline images if they emit `imgcat`/`pdfcat` style escape sequences.

This repository includes two helper scripts for server-side use:

- `tools/imgcat.py` — send an image file to the terminal
- `tools/pdfcat.py` — rasterize one or more PDF pages and send them to the terminal

Examples:

```bash
python3 tools/imgcat.py screenshot.png
python3 tools/imgcat.py diagram.jpg --cols 100
python3 tools/pdfcat.py paper.pdf --page 1
python3 tools/pdfcat.py slides.pdf --page 2 --page 3 --cols 120
```

Notes:

- `imgcat.py` sends PNG directly. Non-PNG inputs require Pillow or ImageMagick.
- `pdfcat.py` requires one of `pdftoppm`, `mutool`, or ImageMagick on the server.
- The scripts are meant to run on the remote machine inside Phantty, not on Windows host side.

## Configuration

Phantty uses a Ghostty-compatible config file format (`key = value` pairs). The config file is loaded from `%APPDATA%\phantty\config`.

Press `Ctrl+,` to open the config file in your default editor, or run `phantty.exe --show-config-path` to print the resolved path.

CLI flags override config file values (last wins).

### Example config

```
font-family = Cascadia Code
font-style = regular
font-size = 14
cursor-style = bar
cursor-style-blink = true
theme = Poimandres

| `remote-session-key`        | *(none)*   | Fixed remote session key base. The first local Phantty instance uses it directly; later concurrently running instances use `_1`, `_2`, `_3`, and so on.                                                                  |


When `remote-enabled = true`, Phantty creates one RemoteClient for the running
instance. All tabs and splits publish PTY output through that shared client, and
the generated session key is printed in the debug console and shown in the
in-window remote status pill. Click the remote status pill to copy the active
session key, or use `Copy Remote Key` from the command center.

By default the session key is random for every process. Set
`remote-session-key = mypass` to use predictable keys for multiple concurrent
local Phantty instances: the first process gets `mypass`, the next gets
`mypass_1`, then `mypass_2`, `mypass_3`, and so on. This only chooses the relay
session key that the remote browser enters; it is separate from the web admin
login password configured on the relay server.

## FAQ

### Why isn't my default PowerShell running as Administrator?

Phantty does not elevate shells on its own. Shells inherit the same privilege
level as the running `phantty.exe` process. Starting Phantty normally (for
example double-click or a non-elevated shortcut) gives you a standard token, even
if your account is in the Administrators group (UAC split token).

### How do I run an elevated (Administrator) shell?

- **Run Phantty elevated:** Right-click `phantty.exe` or its shortcut and choose
  **Run as administrator**. New tabs in that instance inherit the elevated
  token, so the default profile should show Administrator-level access after UAC
  approval.
- **Separate elevated window only:** From any shell,
  `Start-Process pwsh -Verb RunAs` (or `powershell`) starts a new elevated
  process after UAC; it does not replace the current Phantty tab.

There is no supported way to promote an existing non-elevated shell to elevated
without a new process and UAC consent.

### Why does Phantty Remote mirror the local terminal size on phones?

Phantty Remote mirrors the local Phantty window because the desktop app is the
source of truth for terminal state. The local PTY, Ghostty VT state, scrollback,
cursor position, and split layout are captured there and sent to the browser as
layout snapshots plus output bytes.

The remote web UI can rearrange how panels are shown, for example focusing one
surface on mobile instead of squeezing every split into the viewport. It does
not currently create a separate mobile-sized terminal grid. Reflowing the
terminal to the phone width would require either resizing the local terminal
itself, which would disturb the desktop session, or adding a separate remote PTY
or viewport model.
