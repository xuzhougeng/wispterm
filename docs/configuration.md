# Configuration

WispTerm uses a Ghostty-compatible config file format (`key = value` pairs). The
main config path is resolved in this order:

1. `--config <path>` or `--config-path <path>`
2. `wispterm.conf` next to the executable (portable profile, Windows only)
3. Platform config directory:
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\wispterm\config`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/wispterm/config`
   - **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wispterm/config` (fallback: `~/.config/wispterm/config`)

Press the configured `open_config` shortcut (default `Ctrl+,`, `Cmd+,` on macOS) to open the
config file in your default editor, or run `wispterm --show-config-path` to
print the resolved path.

CLI flags override config file values (last wins). `config-file = extra.conf`
and `--config-file extra.conf` include additional config files; they do not
change the main config path.

| `window-width`              | `0` (auto) | Initial width in cells (min: 10, 0 = auto 80x24)                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `quake-mode`                | `false`    | Start as a Quake-style drop-down terminal. The `toggle_quake` keybind hides or shows the same window while preserving terminal state, and the Quake window's size and position are remembered across restarts.            |
| `keybind`                   | defaults   | Configure an app-level shortcut. Can be repeated. Syntax: `keybind = [global:]modifier+key=action`; use `keybind = clear` before custom bindings to remove all defaults.                                                 |
| `scrollback-limit`          | `10000000` | Scrollback buffer limit in bytes                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `url-open-mode`             | `embedded` | Where web URLs open: `embedded` uses the right-side browser panel when available (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS), while `system-browser` always opens the system default browser. SSH loopback URLs keep local port forwards alive for either mode. |
| `restore-tabs-on-startup`   | `false`    | Persist tab/split layout to the platform config directory (`session.json`) on close and rebuild it on next launch. SSH passwords are never persisted; reconnects re-prompt. CLI overrides (`--cwd`) take precedence and skip restore. |
| `auto-update-check`         | `true`     | Check GitHub Releases after startup and show a clickable prompt when a newer version is available. Set to `false` to disable startup checks.                                                                             |
| `config-file`               | *(none)*   | Include another config file (prefix with `?` to make optional)                                                                                                                                                          |
| `ai-default-profile`        | *(none)*   | Saved AI profile name used by New Agent, startup auto-open, remote auto-open, and Copilot defaults. Empty falls back to the first saved profile. `/model` changes only the current session and does not rewrite this key. |
| `ai-agent-enabled`          | `false`    | Enable agent tools for AI Chat profiles by default.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `ai-agent-permission`       | `ask`      | Agent tool permission mode: `ask`, `auto`, or `full`.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ai-agent-command-timeout-ms` | `60000`  | Timeout budget for agent shell/SSH commands.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `ai-agent-output-limit`     | `16384`    | Maximum bytes returned from a single tool result.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ai-agent-working-dir`      | *(none)*   | Default working directory for agent local commands. Empty leaves it unset.                                                                                                                                              |
| `copilot-hint`              | `true`     | Show the right-edge Copilot summon handle and one-time shimmer hint. Set to `false` to hide that discovery affordance.                                                                                                  |
| `remote-enabled`            | `false`    | Start the shared outbound RemoteClient for this WispTerm instance                                                                                                                                                        |
| `remote-server-url`         | *(none)*   | Cloudflare relay URL, for example `https://remote.example.com`                                                                                                                                                          |
| `remote-server-fingerprint` | *(none)*   | Expected relay fingerprint for server identity pinning                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `remote-device-name`        | *(none)*   | Friendly device name sent with the WispTerm WebSocket pairing                                                                                                                                                            |
| `remote-session-key`        | *(none)*   | Fixed remote session key base. The first local WispTerm instance uses it directly; later concurrently running instances use `_1`, `_2`, `_3`, and so on.                                                                  |
| `focus-follows-mouse`       | `false`    | Focus whichever split panel the mouse is over, without clicking.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `confirm-close-running-program` | `true` | Ask for confirmation before closing a panel or tab that is running a full-screen TUI (anything on the alternate screen, such as `vim` or `htop`).                                                                        |
| `right-click-action`        | *(none)*   | Right-click behavior in the terminal: `paste`, or `copy-or-paste` (copy when a selection exists, otherwise paste).                                                                                                      |
| `copy-on-select`            | `false`    | Copy the terminal selection to the clipboard automatically as soon as you select it.                                                                                                                                    |
| `ssh-legacy-algorithms`     | `false`    | Append compatibility options (`ssh-rsa`, old Diffie-Hellman KEX, CBC ciphers) for legacy SSH servers and bastions.                                                                                                      |
| `windows-conpty`            | `auto`     | Windows console host: `auto` prefers the bundled modern ConPTY when `conpty.dll` + `OpenConsole.exe` sit next to `wispterm.exe` (shipped in the portable-compat package; restores TUI mouse support on old Windows 10); `system` forces the OS in-box ConPTY. |
| `wispterm-d3d-present`      | `true`     | Windows: present frames via a DXGI flip-model swapchain. Set `false` to force the classic GDI presenter (useful on weak integrated GPUs; since v1.19.1 affected machines also switch automatically).                    |

When `remote-enabled = true`, WispTerm creates one RemoteClient for the running
instance. All tabs and splits publish PTY output through that shared client, and
the generated session key is printed in the debug console and shown in the
in-window remote status pill. Click the remote status pill to copy the active
session key, or use `Copy Remote Key` from the command center.

By default the session key is random for every process. Set
`remote-session-key = mypass` to use predictable keys for multiple concurrent
local WispTerm instances: the first process gets `mypass`, the next gets
`mypass_1`, then `mypass_2`, `mypass_3`, and so on. This only chooses the relay
session key that the remote browser enters; it is separate from the web admin
login password configured on the relay server.

## Settings page

You do not have to edit the config file by hand. Open the command center
(`Ctrl+Shift+P`, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and run **Settings** to open an in-app
settings page that edits the most common options: font size, theme, cursor style
and blink, focus-follows-mouse, restore-tabs-on-startup, the default shell, the
default AI profile, WeChat direct control, and the interface language. The page
also has an **Open raw config** button for the advanced keys above, and changes
are written back to the same config file. Some options (such as language) take
effect after a restart.

The **Restore default settings** row resets the settings the page manages back
to their defaults after a confirmation dialog. It only clears the keys exposed on
the settings page; it leaves Quake mode, your saved AI profiles, and custom
`keybind` lines untouched.

## OpenSSH config import

Open the command center and run **Load OpenSSH Config** to import compatible
entries from `~/.ssh/config` into WispTerm's SSH profiles. WispTerm imports
`Host`, `HostName`, `User`, `Port`, and `ProxyJump`, skips wildcard host
patterns, and does not import passwords. Imported profiles use the
`credentials` auth method, so OpenSSH config, default keys, ssh-agent, and
platform credential providers remain in charge of authentication.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

WispTerm follows Ghostty's `keybind = trigger=action` style for app-level
shortcuts. Prefix a binding with `global:` when the shortcut should be
registered system-wide (Win32 hotkey on Windows, CGEventTap on macOS); the
first global use case is Quake mode.

```text
keybind = alt+f10=toggle_command_palette
keybind = ctrl+shift+t=new_session
keybind = global:ctrl+backquote=toggle_quake
```

Supported modifiers are `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, and `win` (Windows) / `cmd` (macOS). Common key names
include letters, digits, `f1`-`f24`, `backquote`, `comma`, `plus`, `minus`,
`bracket_left`, `bracket_right`, `enter`, `tab`, `escape`, and arrow keys.

Current app-level actions include `toggle_command_palette`, `toggle_quake`,
`new_session`, `new_window`, `split_right`, `toggle_file_explorer`,

## Command Snippets

Command snippets are reusable text payloads you trigger from the command center
(`Ctrl+Shift+P`, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS). Selecting one sends its text to the
**active session** — local shell, WSL, PowerShell, or SSH — so a fixed command
lives in WispTerm instead of being re-aliased on every machine you connect to.

Each snippet is one Markdown file under a `snippets/` directory next to your
config file:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\wispterm\snippets\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/wispterm/snippets/`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wispterm/snippets/` (fallback: `~/.config/wispterm/snippets/`)

The file name is ignored; the front matter and body define the snippet:

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: build and ship to production
---
make deploy
```

- `name` — required. The title shown in the command center and what you type to
  filter to it.
- `description` — optional. Extra text that the filter also matches.
- **body** — everything after the front matter. This is the exact text sent to
  the session, byte for byte.

**Run vs. insert:** the body is sent verbatim, so a trailing newline decides
what happens. End the body with a newline (the example above) and the command
runs immediately; remove the final newline and the text is only inserted at the
prompt for you to review and press Enter yourself. Note that many editors add a
trailing newline on save — that is the "run immediately" case.

Snippets are re-read every time you open the command center, so edits show up
without restarting WispTerm.

### Let the Copilot create snippets

You do not have to hand-write the file. Because the AI Copilot already has a
`write_file` tool, you can just ask it:

> Create a WispTerm command snippet named `gs` that runs `git status`. Snippets
> live in `~/Library/Application Support/wispterm/snippets/` as a Markdown file
> with `name:` front matter and the command in the body, ending with a newline
> so it runs on selection.

The Copilot writes the `.md` file for you; open the command center and the new
snippet is already there.
